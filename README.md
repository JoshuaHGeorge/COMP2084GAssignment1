This program is designed to allow you to keep track of all your upcoming school work in one place like a planner.
It was inspired by how cumbersome this task is on the schools website and so I wanted to make my own place where I would be able to see all upcoming tests, assignments, etc. at a glance without having to navigate through a bunch of different pages to find everything.

You can put in any number of different work types you like as well as all of your classes.

Once you have you can input your upcoming events with their due dates and on one screen the website shows you all of your upcoming work, with information on what class and type of work it is as well as, how long until its due which is represented both by text and by a <a href="https://plannerjoshuahgeorge.azurewebsites.net/Homework">dynamic infographic</a> bellow the table that shows you how far away from or passed the deadline your work is.

In the info deadline is represented by the red line. As the incoming works dates come on green bars from the right side of the screen towards it (if its not do for a long time it might be to far away to show up here as this part is meant to show you what your immediate priorities should be for around the next week) and if the due date has passed, then its passed due. Hopefully you got it in on time and just haven't deleted it yet.

The website can be found <a href="https://plannerjoshuahgeorge.azurewebsites.net/">here</a> for your convenience.
